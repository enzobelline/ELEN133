%% Step 6
% Compare the results of Steps 4 and 5 with respect to the filterâ€™s ability to suppress one of the
% tones. What is the effect of reducing w? What is the effect of increasing N? Chose a set of values
% for N and w that you think would be the best to use in filters that would reliably distinguish the
% row 2 tone from the row 1 tone and j

%Increasing 2 makes it much more stable while increase n increases the
%accuracy of perception as we take more samples. I think 150 and 2 would be
%great.
